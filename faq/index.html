              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Scoring in Flip 7 is straightforward. At the end of each round (after all players have either busted or stayed), calculate each active player's points as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Add up the values of all your number cards. (For example, cards 3, 7, and 9 would sum to 19 points.)</li>
                  <li>If you have an x2 multiplier card, double the sum of your number cards. Note: The x2 card only doubles your number cards' total – it does NOT double any bonus or "+" modifier card points.</li>
                  <li>Add any points from Modifier cards (+2, +4, +6, +8, +10). These cards simply add their printed value to your number-card total.</li>
                  <li>If you flipped 7 unique number cards, add the 15-point Flip 7 bonus. This bonus applies only if you hit the seven-card streak in that round.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After applying steps 1–4, the result is your score for that round, which you then add to your cumulative total score. The game continues in further rounds until someone's total score reaches 200 or more points.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" id="faq6">
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>No. The x2 card doubles only the sum of your number cards' values – nothing else. It does not double the 15-point Flip 7 bonus nor any additional points from +2/+4/etc. modifier cards. For example, if your number cards sum to 20 points, an x2 would make that 40, but a +10 modifier would still just add +10 (for 50 total, not 60). The x2 is powerful, but you can't use it to multiply bonuses or other modifiers.</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Flip 7's victory condition is reaching a total of 200+ points, but occasionally two or more players might cross that threshold in the same round. In case of a tie where more than one player exceeds 200 (or exactly 200) points, the game does not end immediately. According to the official rules/FAQ, if at the end of a round two or more players are tied with scores over 200, you simply play additional rounds until one clear winner emerges. In other words, all tied high-scoring players remain in the game (others could rejoin too if they hadn't busted), and you continue into another round. The game only ends when one player alone has the highest score above 200 at round's end.</p>

              What are the action cards in Flip 7 and what do they do?

            <div class="accordion-content" id="faq8">
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Flip 7 features a few special Action cards that shake up the game. These can be played on any active player (including yourself), and if you're the last active player in a round, any action card you draw must target yourself. Here are the action cards and their effects:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Freeze!</strong> – Immediately forces a player to "freeze": that player banks all their current points and is out of the round. Essentially, it makes the target stop drawing cards as if they chose to stay (their turn ends and they keep their points safe). If you draw a Freeze, you can play it on an opponent to knock them out of the round (they score what they had and wait until next round), or play it on yourself strategically to stop if you're content with your points.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Flip Three!</strong> – Forces a player to immediately flip the next three cards in a row. The chosen player (target could be an opponent or yourself) must rapidly draw three cards, one at a time, without stopping. This is risky: if they bust during this sequence, they'll score zero for the round, even though all three cards are still revealed. If they manage to flip all three without busting (or if they hit the Flip 7 bonus mid-sequence), they simply resolve all those cards. Important: if any new action card (another Freeze or Flip Three) is revealed during this forced draw, it still counts as part of the three cards. You finish drawing all required cards first, then afterwards resolve the new action card drawn. Even if the target busted, the extra action card still takes effect – the person who drew it gets to choose an active player to be affected by that new action. In summary, Flip Three can create a chain of effects, but you always draw all three cards before dealing with any newly revealed action.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Second Chance!</strong> – This action card works a bit differently: you keep this card in front of you as a safety net. Later, if you "Hit" and draw a number that would duplicate one of your existing numbers (which would normally bust you), the Second Chance card kicks in – you immediately discard the duplicate number card and discard the Second Chance card instead of busting. In essence, it lets you survive one would-be bust. However, you can only hold one Second Chance at a time. If you draw another Second Chance while you already have one unused, you must give the extra one to another active player (of your choice); if no one else is available (or everyone also has one), then the extra Second Chance is just discarded. All Second Chance cards are removed at the end of the round (used or not), so they don't carry over.</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>The general rule is that the player who draws an action card gets to decide who will be affected by it. For both Freeze and Flip Three, you as the drawer choose any active player as the target (including yourself). Second Chance isn't "aimed" at someone when drawn – it just stays with the person who drew it (unless they already have one, in which case it's passed as described above).</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>No – you can only bust by drawing a duplicate number card. Action cards (Freeze, Flip Three, Second Chance) and Modifier cards (+2, +4, +6, +8, +10, x2) are "safe" in the sense that none of them will cause a bust. When you draw an action or modifier, you simply resolve its effect (or keep it, in the case of Second Chance) and continue playing. So, if you flip a card and it's not a number, you can breathe easy – at least you haven't busted on that draw!</p>

              Can Flip 7 be played solo?

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Yes! Flip 7 can be played solo as a "beat your own score" challenge (often abbreviated BYOS). In fact, the second edition rulebook briefly mentions a solo mode where you try to score 200 points within 5 rounds.</p>
                
                <p>Essentially, you play alone, following the normal rules for flipping, busting, scoring, and resolving action cards (which always target yourself when playing solo). You won't have opponents or action card targeting choices in solo play, so it's more about pushing your luck to maximize your score.</p>
                
                <p>It's a great way to practice the game or enjoy Flip 7 when you don't have a group. Keep track of your round scores (using a score sheet or the Flip 7 Tracker tool) and challenge yourself to improve on your high score if you don't hit 200.</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Yes, you can enjoy Flip 7 with just two players! Use the standard rules – each of you flips cards on your turn, trying to reach 200 points first.</p>
                
                <p>The dynamic is a bit different with only one opponent – the strategic use of action cards changes slightly, but the game still functions perfectly. One thing to note is that whenever one player busts or stays, the other becomes the only active player, meaning any Freeze or Flip Three that they draw must target themselves (since there's no other player active). This rule is already in the game for end-of-round situations and essentially covers the two-player scenario.</p>
                
                <p>While Flip 7 may be more chaotic with more players, a two-player duel can still be fun and tense – it's just more head-to-head. It's a great option when you only have one other person to play with!</p>

                <p>Hey there! My name's Edward, and no, this isn't an official site – I'm just a big fan of Flip 7 who happens to be terrible at mental math! 😅</p>
                
                <p>I absolutely love playing Flip 7, but I kept getting frustrated trying to keep track of my scores in my head, especially when things got exciting and I was pushing my luck. I'd lose count, forget what I had, or just plain mess up the calculations. So I decided to build this score tracker for myself to use during games.</p>
                
                <p>I figured if I was having this problem, other players probably were too, so I made it available online for anyone who might find it helpful. It's designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use so you can focus on the fun part – the actual game! I hope you find it as useful as I do.</p>

                <p>That's really kind of you to ask! Honestly, just using the site and finding it helpful is support enough for me. I built this because I wanted it to exist, and seeing other Flip 7 players get use out of it is pretty awesome.</p>
                
                <p>But if you're feeling generous and want to buy me a coffee (or tea, I'm not picky!), you can do that at <a href="https://coff.ee/edthedesigner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coff.ee/edthedesigner</a>. It helps keep the site running and fuels my late-night coding sessions when I'm adding new features or fixing bugs.</p>
                
                <p>Most importantly though, just keep enjoying Flip 7 and maybe tell a friend about this tracker if they're struggling with scorekeeping too. That's the best kind of support there is!</p>
